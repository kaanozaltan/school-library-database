# School Library Database

## Project Description
This project is an online database to satisfy different needs of a university library such as borrowing library items, adding new library items and removing existing ones. The system has three user types: students, instructors and librarians. All users have a unique id, name, password, status, cell phone number and email saved in the system. All user types have a few additional attributes of their own. Users will use their ID and password to login to the system. Students, through librarians, can borrow or return library items and also pay their late return fees for items that they didn’t return in time. Meanwhile instructors can assign library items to students, borrow and return library items and also pay their late return fees. Finally, the librarians will act as administrators and handle tasks such as registering and removing library items, warning users and charging late return fees. All of these actions are considered as operations with unique IDs and different types for categorization. Librarians are also able to list all existing users except librarians, along with applying several filters to this search.

Each library item in the system will have a unique ID, title, author or authors, call number, date of publication, year of publication, availability status, language, publisher and description. There are two types of library items, books and journals. Books have edition and print location as extra values while journals have volume and issue. The library items can be listed using combinations of several filters on different attributes by all user types.
