# School Library Database

## Project Description
This project is an online database to satisfy different needs of a university library such as borrowing library items, adding new library items and removing existing ones. The system has three actors. These actors are students and instructors, who are grouped as the users, and librarians. All users have a unique id, name, hashed password, department, status, cell phone number and email saved in the system. Instructors have an additional attribute, which is their office rooms. Students also have an additional attribute indicating whether they are graduates or not. Users will use their password and ID to login to the system. Students, through librarians, can borrow, return or reserve library items and also pay their late return fees for items that they didn’t return in time. Meanwhile instructors, who instruct students, can assign library items to students, borrow, return and reserve library items and also pay their late return fees. Finally, the librarians will act as administrators and handle tasks such as registering and removing library items, warning users and charging late return fees. All of these actions are considered as operations with unique IDs and different types for categorization.

Each library item in the system will have a unique ID, title, author or authors, call number, date of publication, year of publication, availability status, language, publisher and description. There are two types of library items, books and journals. Books have edition and print location as extra values while journals have volume and issue. The library items will be listed according to their ID but they can also be listed by their titles or authors as well. Additionally, users can cycle between seeing only available library items or all items registered to the library. Library items will also have genres which they will be grouped according to and users can see the contents of a genre in the system.
